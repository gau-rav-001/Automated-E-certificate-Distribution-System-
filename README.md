## 📍 Finding Text Positions

The default X/Y values are set for a standard A4 landscape certificate.  
If your text appears in the wrong place, adjust X and Y values:
- **X** = distance from left edge (pixels)
- **Y** = distance from bottom edge (pixels)
- Use the **Center-align** checkboxes for centered text regardless of name length
